Your HTML file is ready to upload into GitHub exactly as written. Save the content as `index.html` on your local machine, then push it to your repository using these steps:

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Save the HTML code in a file named `index.html`.
4. Add the file to git:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   ```
5. Commit the file:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add Obsidian Auto Transport webpage"
   ```
6. Push it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

Would you like me to also prepare a `README.md` file so your GitHub repo looks professional when someone visits it?
